== Origins: Our Starting Point

[%step]
* Emergence from a fragmented landscape of user pools and varied credentials
* Inconsistent authentication strength
* Challenges in onboarding and offboarding experiences
* Manual tasks for Helpdesk and Support personnel
* Lack of comprehensive audit trails

[.notes]
--
* Short wrap up of the histroy and groth, digitalization of fashion and online sales.
* From a local on side retailer to an european ecommerce bussiness
** Several yeas ago, there was Lotus Notes and Blackberries
** Now we have a service landscape base don the old wold of authentication
--

=== But there is more...

[%step]
* Limited to no utilization of multifactor authentication
* Dependence on LDAP with globally shared groups across applications
* No implementation of the principle of least privilege.

[%step]
__The antithesis of modern IT security__ üòû

[.notes]
--
* This is bad - but quiet common for small and medium sized companies
* Traditional setup with Active Directory, Windows-centric, handicrafted.
* That has evolved historically, and we don't want to blame anyone.
* Everyone told us - This is not solveable. 

**Action: Raise your hand if you have ever been in a similar situation!**

== Introducing: Breuninger ID

[%step]
* Transitioning from LDAP to OIDC/SAML for enhanced security
* End-to-End Self Service - from onboarding to offboarding
* Consistent login experience across platforms
* Implementing self-managed client roles to replace global LDAP groups
** Embracing Least Privilege by Default
* Enabling multifactor authentication

=== The Solution

* Handover to Sascha after this slide
** He goes into detail on how we implement this vision
** Our key benefits from using a open solution like keycloak

== Streamlining Responsibilities

[.notes]
--
* On the upcoming slides, I'll talk about how we successfully streamlined responsibilities, ensuring that everyone is tasked with roles they are genuinely equipped to manage.
* √úbersicht dar√ºber wie wir die Verantwortlichkeiten so optimiert haben dass jeder die Aufgaben bekommt f√ºr die er die Verantwortung √ºbernehmen kann
--

Enhance overall security by optimizing responsibilities for each role

== üë®üèº‚Äçüîß The Operator

[.notes]
--
* What expertise does an operator typically possess?
* I'd say it is conducting maintenance activities, such as updating software and it's dependencies to ensure system reliability and performance.
* Welche Skills erwarten wir in der Regel von einem Operator?
* Ich w√ºrde sagen, Konfiguration, Betrieb und Wartung von Services
--

=== Dependencies

Renovate - Keep track of all dependencies

image::images/maintenance-renovate.png[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* To keep track of all the *dependencies like Container, Operator Lifecycle Manager, Maven* et cetera and their updates we are using renovate.
  * Renovate *automatically opens merge requests* in our git repository for every update.
--

=== Rollout

Automate everything

Tests => Merge => Release => Rollout

image::images/pipeline.png[]

[.notes]
--
* We have *automated pipelines and tests* in place that will automatically test every merge request
* For *minor and patch updates*, if the pipeline succeeds the merge request will *automatically be merged* to master
* On the master branch a *new release will automatically* be produced using *semantic release*
* This release is going to be *deployed to production automatically*
--

=== Observability

image::images/monitoring.png[]

[.notes]
--
* To identify *potential issues* and to ensure *critical problems* do not go unnoticed we set up and fine tuned a monitoring system.
* We are using *prometheus and grafana* for that purpose
* We keep *track of logins per client*, *http errors*, *login errors* and *response times*
* If for example the *login error rate goes up really quickly* we fire an alert so the operator can make sure keycloak still behaves
--

== üë®‚Äçüíª The Developer

[.notes]
--
* Developers are the *deal choice for client onboarding*, thanks to their *in-depth knowledge of OIDC/SAML* implementations, which ensures a seamless and tailored integration for each client.
* A *well-defined user model*, complete with *consistent attributes*, ensures a more organized and efficient onboarding experience.
--

=== The Developer

Client configuration and onboarding

image::images/client-manifest.png[[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* To simplify the process, we developed a solution named "*The Client Factory.*"
** *Developers* can submit their *client configuration* by creatign a *pull request*
** We utilized *`jsonschema`* to establish a *Kubernetes-style manifest for clients*, ensuring structured and consistent client configurations.
** Clients can be categorized as either *managed or unmanaged*:
*** *Managed* clients are *fully configured* via these manifests, offering a hands-off approach for seamless integration.
*** *Unmanaged* clients receive only the *essential setup from the factory*, leaving the finer details of configuration to the application owner's discretion.
--

== üë®‚Äçüíº The Application Owner

[.notes]
--
* Only the *application owner* has the necessary insight to reasonably determine access privileges for their application, making them uniquely qualified for this responsibility‚Äîneither helpdesk staff nor operators are equipped to make these decisions.
* hat notwendige Einsicht um Zugriffsberechtigungen vern√ºnftig festzulegen
* Weder Helpdesk-Mitarbeiter noch Operator sind in der Lage diese Entscheidungen zu treffen
--

=== Self-Service

On- and Off-boarding

image::images/keycloak-client-1.png[[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* Using fine grained permissions the onboarding and - probably more important - the offboarding can be done using the keycloak console.
* onboarding / offboarding(!) kann in der Keycloak Console umgesetzt werden
--

=== Manage Roles

Grant or revoke privileges

image::images/keycloak-client-2.png[[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* As an *application owner* you probably do *not* want to grant *equal rights* to everyone.
* And thats fine as long as there is a *technical reason*.
* Using Keycloak the application owner can do that him self.

--

== üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Employee

[.notes]
--
* You want your users to *not reuse credentials on multiple userbases*
* *Classic LDAP* integration makes it hard for the user to figure out wether to use their company credentials or when they need to use individual credentials.
--

=== The last login form

image::images/login.png[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* This is the *only login screen* an employee at Breuninger should ever face
* The login will always be under the *same URL*
* When ever he is confronted with a *different type of login* form he should immediately get *suspicious*
--

=== Personal Information

Update personal information

image::images/user-info.png[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* Employees get enabled to update their personal information like their name or the preferred language.
* Though, honestly, it usualy makes more sense to update things like the name via the HR department.
--

=== Update Credentials

Change password, configure MFA

image::images/user-credentials.png[alt=Renovate,height=500]

[.notes]
--
* The user can as well change their password or add multi factor devices like TOTP applications or passkeys themself.

Let me invite you to a Journey.
A Journey we never believed it would lead us to a stage like we have it here today.

It's a story about how we transformed a grown IT landscape with several logins and systems to a secure
single sign on experience with well defined responsibilites.

////
    A dark place of distributed user pools and multiple credentials 
        Bad off- and onboarding experience
        Reused passwords
        weak / inconsistent password strength
        bad audit trail overview
    Less to no multifactor authentication
    LDAP with global groups shared between apps
    Login on Application
    but... there is hope! We will show you how to escape this hell. 

Introducing: Breuninger ID - The Vision (Felix)

    Vision: 
        End-to-End Self service (Details in the following slides)
        The Least Privilege by default
        Automatable and secure
    OIDC/SAML (vs LDAP)
    Consistent Login (vs by Application)
    Client Roles (vs global LDAP groups)

Implement / Streamlining Responsibilities (Sascha)

    Operator / Maintenance / Monitoring
        Show some terraform, pipelines
        Show automation
        Show Prometheus, Grafana
    Developer  / Client On-boarding
        Talk about why developers are the best choice when it comes to the on-boarding of the client as they are the ones that understand their OIDC/SAML implementation best 
        Show client factory / merge requests
        Well defined user model they can rely on (attributes etc.)
    Application Owner / User On-boarding
        Talk about why the application owner is the only person that is able to reasonable determine who should have access to his application and why neither helpdesk nor operator can fulfill this responsibility 
        Show role assignment in client in keycloak backend
    User / Consistent Login
        Talk about under which circumstances a user can be responsible for not dropping his credentials into  untrustworthy forms
        Show uniform login process vs random application login forms
        Configure / show several MFA mechanisms

Conclusion / Punch-Lineâ†’ (Was ist unsere Message? You can do it!)
We are hiring!

== Origins: Our Starting Point

[%step]
* Emergence from a fragmented landscape of user pools and varied credentials
* Challenges in onboarding and offboarding experiences
* Issues stemming from reused passwords
* Inconsistent password strength
* Lack of comprehensive audit trails


[%notitle]
=== MFA

[%step]
* Limited to no utilization of multifactor authentication
* Dependence on LDAP with globally shared groups across applications
* Direct login through application interfaces

=== Operator / Maintenance / Monitoring

* Show some terraform, pipelines
* Show automation
* Show Prometheus, Grafana

=== Developer  / Client On-boarding

* Talk about why developers are the best choice when it comes to the on-boarding of the client as they are the ones that understand their OIDC/SAML implementation best 
* Show client factory / merge requests
* Well defined user model they can rely on (attributes etc.)

=== Application Owner / User On-boarding

* Talk about why the application owner is the only person that is able to reasonable determine who should have access to his application and why neither helpdesk nor operator can fulfill this responsibility 
* Show role assignment in client in keycloak backend

=== User / Consistent Login
* Talk about under which circumstances a user can be responsible for not dropping his credentials into  untrustworthy forms
* Show uniform login process vs random application login forms
* Configure / show several MFA mechanisms

== Where do we come from

* A dark place of distributed user pools and multiple credentials 
** Bad off- and onboarding experience
** Reused passwords
    ** weak / inconsistent password strength
    ** bad audit trail overview
* Less to no multifactor authentication
* LDAP with global groups shared between apps
* Login on Application

but... there is hope! We will show you how to escape this hell.

* Show client factory / merge requests
* Well defined user model they can rely on (attributes etc.)

=== Application Owner / User On-boarding

* Talk about why the application owner is the only person that is able to reasonable determine who should have access to his application and why neither helpdesk nor operator can fulfill this responsibility 
* Show role assignment in client in keycloak backend

=== User / Consistent Login
* Talk about under which circumstances a user can be responsible for not dropping his credentials into  untrustworthy forms
* Show uniform login process vs random application login forms
